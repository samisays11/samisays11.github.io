I saw it mainly as a tool to upskill myself and fill in the blind spots on my worldviews and business knowledge. Over the last few years the habit has slowly morphed from a pure utilitarian self-improvement tool into an integral part of my identity and how I relax. Lately I read out of curiosity and interest. As I have found The best books i enjoyed are the ones that expanded my knowledge base on areas of interest.</p><h3 id="the-black-swan"><span class="mr-2">The Black Swan</span><a href="#the-black-swan" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780812973815" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Nassim Nicholas Taleb</em> Managing risk is a central theme in our modern world. Rare events often prove to be a crux of history. Most of the time, those events are originally dismissed because they do not meet the center of a bell curve. Nonetheless, because of their potential to have great impact, planning for these events should be considered. Through philosophical discussion, Taleb seeks to change our thoughts to instead focus on these events as potentially impactful. He relies on research of the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (of fractal fame) to illustrate how seemingly unlikely random events occur when looked at prospectively. There are so many great insights in this book, it’s just a must read for anyone who’s looking to expand their knowledge base on historically unpredictable events that define our world. 10/10 will read again</p><h3 id="the-lean-startup"><span class="mr-2">The Lean Startup</span><a href="#the-lean-startup" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-QB7nDh4L.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Eric Ries</em> This book teaches entrepreneurs how to navigate the extreme uncertainties of starting a new venture. By using the scientific method to test ideas, validating and invalidating business hypotheses to arrive at Product Market Fit under the vehicle of a minimal viable product (MVP). Instead of creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers a framework for startups to test, learn, and adjust their strategy through a cycle of continuous improvement. This book for me along with Lean analytics, Growth Hacking and the Cold Start Problem unlocked a high level understanding of what it entails to kick-start a tech start-up.</p><h3 id="evil-by-design"><span class="mr-2">Evil by Design</span><a href="#evil-by-design" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41VLMNu8uWL._AC_SY780_.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Chris Nodder</em> Sloth, pride, envy, greed, lust, anger, gluttony. The list of seven deadly sins provides a nice, tidy statement of fundamental human behavior. Each chapter in this book addresses one of these sins, pointing out the human characteristics that enable software designer to create persuasive interfaces that appeal to each weakness. The 57 patterns described in this book are strong mechanisms for persuasion. They can be used in digital and physical products to increase customer loyalty or to attract new customers. In addition, you can use this information to recognize and avoid being personally persuaded by these principles when they appear in sites you use.<br /> But why should design be based on evil? Simple: starting with evil means starting with real human behavior. This doesn’t mean that the result is evil. It means that understanding what each sin represents adds to an understanding of people and good design results from good understanding.<br /> Truly a good book to consider if you are a product developer or designer. Although some of the behavioral engineering insights might appear to have a Machiavelli’s “The Prince” level of persuasiveness to them.</p><h3 id="hooked"><span class="mr-2">Hooked</span><a href="#hooked" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fcWvYdukL.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Nir Eyal</em> As the sole developer of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grinn/id1430380304/?ls=1&amp;mt=8"><strong>Grinn</strong></a>, this book gave me the blueprint on how to approached building social products.

It focuses on the distortions of symmetry and reciprocity in life: If you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it. Skin in the game, applied as a rule, reduces the effects of the following divergences that grew with civilization: those between action and cheap talk (tawk), consequence and intention, practice and theory, honor and reputation, expertise and charlatanism, concrete and abstract, ethical and legal, genuine and cosmetic, merchant and bureaucrat, entrepreneur and chief executive, strength and display.<br /> TL;DL → <strong>If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing</strong>. <br /> Another intellectual masterpiece by Nassim, this one belongs in every library.</p><h3 id="only-the-paranoid-survive"><span class="mr-2">Only the Paranoid Survive</span><a href="#only-the-paranoid-survive" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*JsH0B-boRi8gsPPmwwlY5w.jpeg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Andy Grove</em> This book is about dealing with difficult crises as a company, based on Andrew’s experience at running Intel.

The author discuses the benefits of growth hacking and provides some examples to help you understand the power it has over traditional marketing. <strong>Biggest lesson: growth can be hacked, measured and scaled using a more scientific experimental and data-drive framework.</strong> The traditional marketing channels are broken. Holiday explains how companies that have come to rely on massive advertising budgets, infomercials, and a broadcast-only marketing focus are missing out on huge opportunities. In Growth Hacker Marketing, he introduces a new class of marketing professional—the growth hacker—and shows how to apply their unconventional tactics to your business.</p><h3 id="wanting"><span class="mr-2">Wanting</span><a href="#wanting" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://kbimages1-a.akamaihd.net/030e316f-311c-42b2-94d6-5e98b88766df/353/569/90/False/wanting-24.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Luke Burgis</em> In the universe of desire, there is no clear hierarchy. People don’t choose objects of desire the way they choose to wear a coat in the winter. Instead of internal biological signals, we have a different kind of external signal that motivates these choices: models.<br /> Models are people or things that show us what is worth wanting. It is models—not our “objective” analysis or central nervous system—that shape our desires. With these models, people engage in a secret and sophisticated form of imitation that Girard termed mimesis (mi-mee-sis), from the Greek word mimesthai (meaning “to imitate”). Models are the gravitational centers around which our social lives turn. It’s more important to understand this now than at any other time in history.<br /> A wonderful book that takes a transformational deep dive into the origins of our desires. Highly recommended.</p><h3 id="hacking-growth"><span class="mr-2">Hacking Growth</span><a href="#hacking-growth" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zKeVUasGL.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Sean Ellis &amp; Morgan Brown</em> Growth Hacking is an area of business management that I’m deeply fascinated by. From the moment I read <strong>Growth Hacker Marketing</strong> by Ryan Holiday I knew I wanted to become a growth hacker someday. So i set out to consolidate every possible information I could find on subject. Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis was the answer to that endless desire for a more detailed explanation on the low level components of what it takes to growth hack a business. Growth Hacking in essence helps companies achieve breakout results by building a culture of continuous experimentation. It addresses the four levers of growth: acquisition, activation, retention, and monetization. It’s recommended for marketers, product managers, or anyone else that wants to drive product adoption or business growth. A fantastic book that I have read over 3 times in the last year. 10/10</p><h3 id="traction"><span class="mr-2">Traction</span><a href="#traction" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OSje3X6UL.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Gabriel Weinberg &amp; Justin Mares</em> In “Traction”, the founder of search engine Duckduckgo, Gabriel Weinberg, shares a fresh way for businesses to think about different phases of growth, with practical tips on how to test and use 19 potential channels to get more customers and achieve massive growth.<br /> <strong>Why Traction ?</strong> To succeed a startup must grow quickly. Traction is the measurable evidence of customer demand. Depending on the nature of your business, it could be the number of app downloads, the number of free/paid subscribers, the number of sales transactions etc. It signals that your company is taking off, and makes it easier to attract investors, talents, partners and publicity. The sales and marketing channels through which you acquire customers are your “traction channels”.<br /> This is one of those books you must read and reread as a startup founder, wanna-be enterpreneur or indie-dev.

The concept of newsjacking as potential growth hack was also a eye opener for me, one i can’t wait to deploy in the near future.</p><h3 id="influence"><span class="mr-2">Influence</span><a href="#influence" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SPjJ+UnLL.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Robert Cialdini</em> Influence is about the six principles of persuasion useful for sales, marketing and negotiation.

The six principles are: reciprocity, consistency, social proof, liking, authority and scarcity.</p><p><br /><br /></p><h3 id="lean-analytics"><span class="mr-2">Lean Analytics</span><a href="#lean-analytics" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 150 150'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UuvH3OzNL.jpg" alt="Desktop View" class="left" width="150" height="150" data-proofer-ignore> <em>By Benjamin Yoskovitz &amp; Alistair Croll</em> This is a very dense book that attempts to explain the world of data collection and analysis to new entrepreneurs. It shows how to use data as a powerful tool to find product market fit, build great product and maintain market dominance.<br /> The 3 big take aways are ↓<br /> → Be data-informed, not data-driven.<br /> → All successful startups go through five distinct stages: Empathy, Stickiness, Virality, Revenue, and Scale.<br /> → Identify the stage your startup is currently at and determine the <strong>one metric that matters</strong> for each stage and ruthlessly prioritize it. <br /> This was by far the best book I have ever read on business analytics. It would be foolish not to read this book if you ever intend to build a tech startup.
