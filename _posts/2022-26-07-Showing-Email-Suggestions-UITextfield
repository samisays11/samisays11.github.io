It can be easy to forget what a truly incredible and powerful class UITextField is, and what it gives you (more or less) for free. It handles input in a variety of languages (possibly including multiple at once!), dictation, bi-directional text, spell checking, auto-correcting, smart-quoting-and-dashing, and more, so that you don't really have to think about what's really going on behind the scenes too much.

Handling text input is a constant battle between flexibility, quick entry, validation, formatting. One of the many tools Apple has helpfully provided to make this a little better is UITextContentType -- a simple concept that we can use to help create more consistency in our apps for how text input is handled. By using UITextContentType and a few other related options, developers can greatly improve the user experience of working with text fields in their apps.
