I love reading, i currently have a routine of 50+ minutes of dedicated daily reading time. That usually amounts to about two to three books a month. It's a fantastic habit that's transformed my world.  
It can't be overstated, reading is a super-power. Habituating it can super-charge your growth trajectory and put you intellectually well above your peers. So how does one systematically develop this habit ? let's find out.

> The genuine love for reading itself, when cultivated, is a superpower. We live in the age of Alexandria, when every book and every piece of knowledge ever written down is a fingertip away. The means of learning are abundantâ€”itâ€™s the desire to learn that is scarce.

## How to Develop a Reading Habit

From my experience there are few important factors one needs to deploy when trying to develop a reading habit. Think of them as a sort of system that helps you get to your end goal. 

1. Sytemize the goal have a time and place setup
2. Frequency, do it everyday
3. Pick High Interest and engaging books on topics you find like. Anything that makes you laugh, gives you more social currency, or that get's you emotionally aroused i.e you're super passionate about the topic, or books that offer practical value. And then give examples of such books for me.
4. Set a timer, and take breaks. Read in bouts of 15, 10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. Slowly increase

### Systemize The Goal


### Set a Pomodoro Timer


### Pick High Interest and Engaging Books

Just like you wouldn't watch a wack ass movie or listen to an uninteresting podcast, pick books that are entertaining same way you pick other mediums of entertainment

### Do It Frequently


### Increase Duration and Diversity of Interest

### Have a To Read List

<!-- 
Whenever someone publishes an article about how to read more books, I click it right away to see what others do to read more often. However, Iâ€™ve noticed the people who write these pieces usually read high numbers of books â€” as many as ten a month.
Iâ€™m going to guess that the reason some people read those articles is that they either want to fall in love with reading again, or they want to become avid readers for the first time in their lives.
While articles that teach you how to read two books a week are fantastic, people who are looking to start (or start again) should aim for a lower goal â€” like two books a month. This way, you avoid feeling overwhelmed. Plus, itâ€™s a habit you can build up over time like any other. -->
