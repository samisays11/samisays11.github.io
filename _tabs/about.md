## Oh, Hello There ðŸ‘‹ 
## Welcome to my Blog


 **I am Osas**, \
 an ï£¿ iOS Developer with a keen Interest on **Behavioral Economics, All things-Psychology and Growth Hacking.** \
 I got into programming in the summer of 2017 to build [**Grinn**](https://link-url-here.org) an ios app that i wanted to design to make me and my buddy laugh at silly memes. The project spured my passion for learning about technology and drove me down a path of consistent desire to upskill myself so i could keep building virtually appealing softwares. \
 I find great joy in creating delightful user expriences through native ios apps.\
 And when I'm not programming you will probably find me geeking out on a book or something related to choice architecture, growth hacking or lifting heavy weights in rags ðŸ˜‚ 

 > This blog is a repositiory of insights from my favorite **books, personal discoveries and programming tutorials**; an attempt to document personal evolution in public.
