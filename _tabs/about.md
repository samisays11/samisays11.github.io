**I read a lot** 🤓

**I write a lot** ✍️

##  About my iOS Journey...

 I got into iOS Development in the **summer of 2017** to build [**Grinn**](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grinn/id1430380304/?ls=1&mt=8), an ios meme app that i initally designed to send memes to my friends. The project spurred my passion for learning about technology and gave me a consistent desire to upskill myself. The **Swift** programming language was my first love, It was love at first code and gave me a creative outlet to express myself with it's modern and delightful syntax.  
 I have played around with **Kotlin** and **JavaScript** but i still have a major bias for **Swift**.

<!-- I like to think of myself as a knowledge athlete. I have mastered the art of continous learning, probably why I'm drawn to the tech industry (there's always something to learn). I'm a master of the flow state, inversion & high agency, student of logic and reasoning and when i'm not laughing i'm probably sleeping. -->
<!-- 
**I'm a Solo-tasker**: I’m into only one thing at a time, I hyper-focus on the target till completion, whether that takes hours, months, or even years. I enjoy chunking and sequentially tackling challenges (probaly why i enjoy programming in general).

**I'm overly optimistic**: I'm very optimistic about the future but pessimistic about the present. I always feel like in a long en -->




<!-- 
I think very long-term and future-focused. Even as a teenager, when friends would tease me for not having tattoos or piercings, I never got them because my first thought is, “Will I want that when I’m 80?” If not, then why do it? My present life is in service of my future self. I tend to do things for my future, not my present.
I like women. Almost all of my best friends are women. Gender stereotypes bristle me.
I’m wary of anything that feels like addiction. Whether drinking, phone/internet use, playing games, or whatever — if people tend to get an unhealthy addiction to it, I avoid it.
I care deeply about very little. I’m committed to just a few people and a few interests. Everything else, I keep away. (See “hell yeah or no”.) It’s a simple and sincere life.
I walk away — to a fault. I’m not a fighter. When something’s not to my liking — or if something gets too confrontational or antagonistic — I just leave. Since I’m happy being alone, the bar is set really high to make me engage with a person or situation that I’m not enjoying.
I’m deliberate. I don’t believe in the “I can’t help the way I am” approach to life. Only dead fish go with the flow. I change who I am to get what I want, instead of the other way around.
I hate noise. I’m always seeking silence. I don’t like crowds, cities, bars, parties, streets, etc. I damaged my hearing at a concert when I was 13, with a loud ringing ever since, so I don’t know if it’s due to that or not, but in a crowd I can’t pick out one voice from another. So meeting people in noisy places is pointless, since I can’t understand what anyone is saying. It’s another reason I prefer quiet one-on-one conversations. I even go to the gym late at night, after they close, so I can work out in silence.
I hate to waste a single hour. I feel the precious value of time, most of the time. I imagine my time as worth $1000 an hour, and ask myself what’s worth $1000. Watching a TV show? Absolutely not. (“Game of Thrones” was 70 hours, so would have cost $70,000 to watch.) Social media? Absolutely not. Focused learning or creating? Yep! Being with my kid? Always. -->

<!-- ## Oh, Hello There 👋 
## Welcome to my Blog


 **I am Osas**, \
 an  iOS Developer with a keen Interest on **Behavioral Economics, All things-Psychology and Growth Hacking.** \
 I got into programming in the summer of 2017 to build [**Grinn**](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grinn/id1430380304/?ls=1&mt=8) an ios app that i wanted to design to make me and my buddy laugh at silly memes. The project spured my passion for learning about technology and drove me down a path of consistent desire to upskill myself so i could keep building virtually appealing softwares. \
 I find great joy in creating delightful user expriences through native ios apps.\
 And when I'm not programming you will probably find me geeking out on a book or something related to choice architecture, growth hacking or lifting heavy weights in rags 😂
